# Match Israel

Following the tragic events of October 7th, the worldwide Jewish community united to help their family in Israel. Springing into action, global Jewry donated billions of dollars to Israel, supporting non-profits, soldiers, communities, individuals, and the country. The financial inflows have truly proved to be lifesaving.

The Match Israel was founded in early 2025 to help donors outside of Israel continue this imperative assistance. Match Israel showcases small and vetted non-profits who are doing crucial work for Israeli society, both related to the events of October 7th and beyond. But our aim isn’t just to showcase them—we want to give donors the opportunity to connect with the organizations and the people themselves. We believe that having a connection to the organization you’re donating to will make your donation feel more fulfilling. You’ll be able to keep in touch with the organization and see firsthand how far your donation goes, if you so choose.

All of our featured non-profits have agreed to be contacted directly by you—all you have to do is click the button to send an email or WhatsApp and they’ll get back to you to schedule a meeting. It’s that simple. They want to hear from you!
